* Description
  Archmacs is a customized, opinionated Arch Linux distribution that integrates Spacemacs and EXWM at its core. It is designed to deliver a streamlined, keyboard-centric environment tailored for software development, DevOps workflows, and network engineering.

  The system comes pre-configured with a curated selection of packages, custom Spacemacs layers, and a unified theme—turning Emacs into both your editor and your window manager.

* Features
  - **EXWM (Emacs X Window Manager):** A full-featured tiling window manager embedded within Emacs for seamless control.
  - **Pre-configured Spacemacs:** A custom Spacemacs configuration with additional layers, themes, and keybindings for development and system operations.
  - **Arch Linux Base:** Leverages the rolling-release model, AUR access, and minimal base for flexibility and performance.
  - **Developer & DevOps Tooling:** Pre-installed packages for languages (Python, Go, Rust, etc.), containers (Docker, Podman), orchestration (k8s tools), and infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible).
  - **Networking Utilities:** Includes common networking tools (nmap, wireshark, tcpdump, iperf3, net-tools, etc.).
  - **Unified Theming:** Consistent visual theme across GTK, terminals, Emacs, and EXWM.
  - **Dotfiles Management:** System and user configurations are managed via a dedicated dotfiles repository for easy replication.

* Quick Start (Installation)

  **Warning:** This is a highly customized distribution. Recommended for experienced Arch Linux and Emacs users.

  1. Download the latest ISO from the =Releases= page.
  2. Create a bootable USB (e.g., with =dd= or =balenaEtcher=).
  3. Boot from the USB and follow the installer (if an installer is provided). Otherwise, follow the manual installation steps below.

  **Manual Installation (Advanced):**
  - Boot the Archmacs ISO and connect to the internet.
  - Partition and format your disks as needed.
  - Mount the root partition to =/mnt=.
  - Use =pacstrap= to install the base system and the =archmacs-base= package group.
  - Generate =fstab=, =chroot= into the new system, set locale, timezone, hostname, and root password.
  - Install and configure a bootloader.
  - Reboot.

* Usage
  Upon first login, EXWM will start automatically. Your Spacemacs configuration is ready to use.

  - **Default Modifier:** The main modifier key for EXWM is =Super= (Windows key).
  - **Launch Programs:** Use =M-x shell= or =M-x term= for a terminal.
  - **EXWM Basics:**
    - =S-RET=: Launch terminal.
    - =S-d=: Launch application via dmenu.
    - =S-q=: Close current window.
    - =S-f=: Toggle fullscreen.
    - =S-0..9=: Switch to workspace.
  - **Spacemacs:** The default leader key is =SPC=.
